# Naming-Name-Models

This repository contains the updated scripts in Python 3.8 to simulate the Naming Game (NG) model and its many variants. During the last recent years while I was developing a new variant of NG based upon the Bayesian inference, I wrote many scripts for simulating the dynamics of the older models, including its realization in different types of complex networks such as random graphs, graphs with small-world properties  and scale-free networks. However, the scripts were written in Python 2.7 as this version was required for running the scripts in parallel on computer clusters. For this reason, I am rewriting the previous scripts in Python 3.8, adding also some changes when required.

## Python Versions and Required Packages  
The scripts has been tested  with Python 3.8.10. 3.8.16, 3.11.5

The following library is also required for running the scripts
 - [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
